    <p1> 
        My name Lorie, I was born on the 28<sup>th</sup> of May 2001 and I am from a small island name Mauritius. It is located in the Indian Ocean and growing up, the island life was perfect for me.
        I love the beach, sunsets and romance novels. Sunsets reminds me of my island and I just get home sick everytime I see one.
