    <article>About Me</article>
    <p> 
        My name Lorie, I was born on the 28<sup>th</sup> of May 2001 and I am from a small island name Mauritius. It is located in the Indian Ocean and growing up, the island life was perfect for me.
        I love the beach, sunsets and romance novels. Sunsets reminds me of my island and I just get home sick everytime I see one. 
    </p>
    <p> Fun fact about me, I am a musician and ballerina, and was always dedicated to those two passions. Violin was my escape from the real world and 
        ballet was a from of expression. <abbr title="to be honest">TBH</abbr> being creative has always been a part of me which explaind why I am pursuing in the design field.
